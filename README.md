MicroManager - A Strategy Game of Organelles and Energy -

Katherine Gonzalez - BIOL 2301 - CRN #12034 - Extra Credit

GOAL:
- In Micromanager, you literally manage life at the smallest scale. Guide a eukaryotic cell through 10 perilous turns. Allocate resources, coordinate organelle functions, and manage synthesis, repair, and waste as random stressors strike!

EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES:
- Understand organelle functions and their roles in cellular homeostasis
- Understand cellular waste management through autophagy
- Learn about ATP, protein synthesis
- Cellular respiration
- Membrane dynamics: Phospholipid bilayer requires constant lipid synthesis
- Active vs Passive transport

GAME MECHANICS:
- 10-turn survival challenge with turn-based phases: Import → Events → Actions → Maintenance
- 5-dot resource visualization system (●●●○○)
- Win condition: Survive all 10 turns with positive health/membrane/ATP
- Lose conditions: Health ≤ 0, Membrane ≤ 0, or ATP ≤ 0 for 2 turns

## How to Run the Game in GitHub Codespaces (No Download Needed)

   https://github.com/kat-o-lantern/micromanager
2. Click the green **Code** button at the top right.
3. Select the **Codespaces** tab.
4. Click **"Create codespace on main"** (this will open a VS Code-like editor in your browser).
5. When the Codespace loads, open the terminal (bottom panel). If it’s not visible, go to **Terminal → New Terminal**.
6. Run the game with: Python
   ```bash
   python micromanager.py
